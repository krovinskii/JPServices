# Learning Astro by Building a Static Site for a Small Business

Welcome to my project where I'm learning Astro by building a static website for a small business! This project serves as a hands-on way for me to dive into the basics of Astro and static site generation. The goal is to create a simple, modern, and responsive website for a small business, showcasing its services, products, and contact details.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a static website for a fictional small business. The website will include:

- **Home Page**: A brief introduction to the business, its mission, and values.
- **About Page**: More details about the business history, team, and objectives.
- **Services Page**: A list of services/products the business offers with descriptions.
- **Contact Page**: A simple contact form and business contact information (email, phone number, and address).
- **Blog Section**: To showcase any blog posts or updates related to the business.

By building this project, I will familiarize myself with the following:

- Basic Astro setup
- Component-based architecture
- Markdown support for content management
- Static site generation with Astro
- Integrating external resources (CSS, images, etc.)
- SEO optimization and performance best practices

## What I’ve Learned So Far

- How to scaffold a new Astro project using the CLI
- File-based routing in Astro (`/src/pages`)
- Creating and reusing `.astro` components
- Using Markdown files to generate blog content
- Embedding components inside Markdown with `MDX`
- Using the `<Image />` component for optimization
- Organizing layout components for consistent page structure
- Writing clean, responsive styles with Flexbox and `rem` units
