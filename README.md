# Learning Astro by Building a Static Site for a Small Business

Welcome to my project where I'm learning Astro by building a static website for a small business! This project serves as a hands-on way for me to dive into the basics of Astro and static site generation. The goal is to create a simple, modern, and responsive website for a small business, showcasing its services, products, and contact details.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a static website for a fictional small business. The website will include:

- **Home Page**: A brief introduction to the business, its mission, and values.
- **About Page**: More details about the business history, team, and objectives.
- **Services Page**: A list of services/products the business offers with descriptions.
- **Contact Page**: A simple contact form and business contact information (email, phone number, and address).
- **Blog Section**: To showcase any blog posts or updates related to the business.

By building this project, I will familiarize myself with the following:

- Basic Astro setup
- Component-based architecture
- Markdown support for content management
- Static site generation with Astro
- Integrating external resources (CSS, images, etc.)
- SEO optimization and performance best practices

## Technologies Used

- **Astro**: A modern static site generator for building fast websites.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structure and styling.
- **Markdown**: For content creation (pages and blog posts).
- **JavaScript (optional)**: For any dynamic functionality.
- **Image Optimization**: Using Astro's built-in tools for efficient image loading.
